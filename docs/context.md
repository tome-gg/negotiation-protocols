# Context

## Challenges

There are three (3) major hurdles in bringing the  educational innovation that Tome.gg is pursuing (i.e. "hyper-contextualized learning"):

### 1. 📚️ **Educational Inaccessibility**

Financial barriers to accessing educational material, Time and effort spent searching/skimming/reading/getting lost in the internet/library.

### 2. 🏃‍♂️ **Expensive Contextualization**

Languages and technologies evolve, and so do people. It takes time to transfer learning from one context to another (e.g. age groups: 40y/o teaching 25 y/os). Context switching is painful. In many parts of the world, personalizing education is expensive, if not unavailable.

### 3. 💰️ **Inexperience and Friction in Negotiation**

Establishing and negotiating a mentoring engagement is a pain point for both mentors and apprentices.

## How might we improve the overall experience of alignment and negotiation between mentors and apprentices?

From those challenges, Tome.gg tackles the third problem of alignment negotiation between mentors and apprentices in this repository.
